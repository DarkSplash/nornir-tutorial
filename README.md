# nornir-tutorial
This repo contains the bare minimum configuration that is needed to start a Nornir script. All of the files contain comments describing why certain steps are being taken or why certain variables are filled out the way they are.

This tutorial was made during Nornir release 3.3.0, so things may be subject to change if you are using a newer release. In which case, I would recommend checking out https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ to see the lastest documentation on Nornir
